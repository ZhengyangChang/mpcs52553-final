Nice work!

- Six models is a bit on the bigger side. To make the app the as simple as possible, I would see if there are any
models/associations you can do without (maybe `Message`?).

- Try to see if there are more validations you could add, such as `validates_presence_of :address` for the `House` model

- `login` (`User` model) is a bit unclear -- I'm guessing it will be an email/username, but I would make this column name 
more specific, since you'll probably be limiting it to one of the two.
