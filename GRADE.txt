PROJECT GRADE

Score: 25/30

Nice work!  Just a few things:

1. You need to implement authorization in your controllers.  Otherwise, a major
security breach can occur.  For exmaple, I can get to /users/1 and see the user's information
without signing in at all.

2. I see code for making reservations and payments, but I can't find the UI to do so.
(I'm assuming I'm missing something obvious so I didn't deduct much for that)

Have a great summer. :-)

Nice work!

- Six models is a bit on the bigger side. To make the app the as simple as possible, I would see if there are any
models/associations you can do without (maybe `Message`?).

- Try to see if there are more validations you could add, such as `validates_presence_of :address` for the `House` model

- `login` (`User` model) is a bit unclear -- I'm guessing it will be an email/username, but I would make this column name
more specific, since you'll probably be limiting it to one of the two.

Great job.

- Styles (such as in `sessions/new.html.erb`) should generally be included in layout file.
